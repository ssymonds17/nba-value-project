     The results indicate that this metric highlights the contributions of second or third options on great teams to a far greater extent than a standard “greatest list” usually would and provides a clearer view of how much credit the first option on a team should actually receive.

     For example, Scottie Pippen most usually would be acknowledged at most as a top 25-30 player all time, in other cases he would be much further down. The main reason for this is because he was never the first option on his team (1994 notwithstanding). Obviously this is because the number one option on his team was Michael Jordan, who would be the number one option on any team he played on. However, Scottie Pippen not being the number one option should not preclude us from handing out the credit he deserves for what he contributed to an outstanding Chicago Bulls team (and a few Trail Blazer teams) during the 1990s. Just because he didn’t contribute the most, doesn’t mean he didn’t contribute, and looking into the statistics, I believe that his contributions as a second option outweighs the contributions of the majority of number one options in NBA history.

     Alternatively, I think this metric shows a way to look beyond arguments like “6 rings” and more accurately award credit. The best example for this would be Kareem Abdul Jabbar during the 1989 season. His career resume has 6 MVP awards, 6 championships and 2 Finals MVP awards. Occasionally these 6 titles are measured up against Jordan’s 6 championships and assumed to be roughly equal. However, Jordan’s contribution to the Chicago Bulls 6 championships far exceeds the contributions Kareem made to the 5 Laker championships in the 1980s. This is not to denigrate Kareem, but merely a fact. A fact that must be taken into account. Kareem was a leading contributor to the majority of the Lakers champions and should be rewarded accordingly. However, in 1989 for example, Basketball Reference’s VORP metric sees him as basically replacement level. Nothing to be ashamed of considering he was 41 years of age at the time, but by all accounts, there were 4-5 players who contributed more to that title than Kareem did. Should we really put forth this title as an argument for Kareem as the greatest player of all time? I don’t think so. There are dozens of similar examples and this metric cuts through the narratives and highlights them all.
