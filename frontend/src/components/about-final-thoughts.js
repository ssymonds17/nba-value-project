     This website was not created to be an authoritative document within the GOAT debate, nor am I stating that everything presented is true and correct. I understand that there is a fair amount within the methodology that is arbitrary and most likely would not hold up to statistical scrutiny.

    <p>
     I am merely intending that this website be used as a resource, among many, and perhaps as a starting point in a more robust and transparent debate regarding historical player valuations. Everybody has their own criteria and different things that they value when evaluating players and here I am outlining my criteria and presenting how I came to my final conclusions as clearly as I possibly can.
